> Welcome to Programming Project 1:
> Programming Project 1 aims to constuct an algorithm for finding the closest pairs of points in P.
> The algorithm inputs are P and m. Distances will be returned between the m closest pairs of points, 
> including their x and y coordinates.

## Project Requirements

An algorithm will be defined using pseudocode.
The worst-case running time will be determined.
Assignment instructions included:

  - Implementation of the algorithm
  - Asymptotic behavior measurements
  - Comparing algorithm's worst-case to code's worst case
  - Trace runs
  
## Compiling Instructions
IDE used - Eclipse / Compiler used - JDT / Programming Language - Java
> Instructions to run code: 
  1. Open the .java programs on Eclipse (Coordinate.java, PairofCoordinates.java, CoordinateSolution.java)
  2. click on the Run button for CoordinateSolutions.java
  3. Input the number of coordinate points to generate randomly (P value):
  4. Input the value of m you wish to obtain: 
  5. Console will output the coordinate points and distance between the closest pairs of points.
