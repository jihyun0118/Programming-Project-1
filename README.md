> Welcome to Programming Project 1:
> Programming Project 1 aims to constuct an algorithm for finding the closest pairs of points in P.
> The algorithm inputs are P and m. Distances will be returned between the m closest pairs of points, 
> including their x and y coordinates.

## Overview - Project Requirements

An algorithm will be defined using pseudocode.
The worst-case running time will be determined.
Assignment instructions included:

  - Implementation of the algorithm
  - Trace runs
  - Asymptotic behavior measurements
  - Analysis comparing algorithm's worst-case to code's worst case will be compared.
