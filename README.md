> Welcome to Programming Project 1:
> Programming Project 1 aims to constuct an algorithm for finding the closest pairs of points in P.
> The algorithm inputs are P and m. Distances will be returned between the m closest pairs of points, 
> including their x and y coordinates.

## Project Requirements

An algorithm will be defined using pseudocode.
The worst-case running time will be determined.
Assignment instructions included:

  - Implementation of the algorithm
  - Asymptotic behavior measurements
  - Comparing algorithm's worst-case to code's worst case
  - Trace runs
  
## Compiling Instructions
IDE used - Eclipse
Compiler used - JDT
Programming Language - Java
> Instructions to run code: 
  1. Open the .java program
  2. click on the Run button
